# REST-API

Built a REST API which serves JSON-only responses using 

Express web framework to handle the API’s Routing, 

Integrated Mongoose to handle interactions with MongoDB which persists the API’s data, and 

Tested the API’s routes with Postman REST Client. 

This API’s data powers a front end Q&A user interface where a user can ask questions, answer them, vote on answers which are organized based on user votes.
